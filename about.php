		<p class="about">
			In a society where who you know is often more important than what you know, being introduced to someone could be the difference of whether or not you are offered the job or internship or whatever. We invite many different companies out to do info sessions so students have the opportunity to make their impression on recruiters for the companies they are interested in working for.
